# üìù A simple todo list

## Background:
This is a school final project, even the website is relatively simple but i learn a lot from this

<br/>

## Set up the database:
Mysql Workbench is used as the database. You will only have to modify this part

#### app.py:
```bash
db_connect = {
    'host': '127.0.0.1',  # mysql host 
    'port': 3306,  # my port (feel free to change)
    'user': 'root',  # default user name
    'password': 'YOUR_PASWORD'
}
```


## TIPS:
the web won't reload __dynamically__ so click the refresh button after saving the files
